# Task #1
**Session #1:** Intro to Linux and the Command Line

**Deadline:** Thursday 7/8 at 11:59 pm

## Submission Guidelines üìÅ
Task correction is **automatic**. Please follow the guidelines to ensure that your task is graded correctly.

- Write the required commands in order in `solution.sh`.
- Don't rename any files or folders, unless requested in the task.
- The file `solution.sh` should only contain commands without adding any type of additions, for example:
```bash
cd Linux
echo "Hello world"
```
- Test your solution by running:
```bash
./check.sh
```
- **Note:** Running the check resets the task, but you can run `./solution.sh` to re-run your commands and continue where you left.
- Finally, submit your solution by running:
```bash
./submit
```
- Verify your submission by visiting your task repo on GitHub and making sure it has been uploaded there.

## Task Description ‚úèÔ∏è
**Before you start task:** Run `bash restart.sh`
1. You are lost in space and don't know where you are. Use a command to print the current directory path.
2. Great, after we know our location, we have to know what items and places we can go from where we are. Write the command to show the stuff (files and directories) around us.
3. Now, let's go through the first gate.
4. Oh man, there's a trap here. you gotta remove it
5. Oh, look. you found the key to the other gate. Can you make a copy of it and put inside the `gate-2` so you can open it without leaving a sign? 
6. Now we can enter the second gate!
7. Oh, noooooo. The third gate is closed. We have to change (rename) `closed` to `open`.
8. Now move `open` inside `gate-3`, and step inside the third gate.
9. There's also another trap here. Remove it!
10. The fourth gate is open! Step inside `gate-4`.
11. Congrats so far, but we haven't escaped yet. Remove the directories `dimension-y` and `dimension-x` along with their contents.
12. Now, let's go to earth!
13. Oh no, your house is destroyed, can you make a directory called `home` and make a file called `bed` inside `home` so you can finally sleep?
