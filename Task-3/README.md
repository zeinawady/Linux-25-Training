## Task Description

You are inside a broken **digital world**. Everything is gone — people, tribes, and files. Please **fix the system step by step**.
Write every command you use in a file called **solution.sh**.


### **Part 1 – Make the People**

* Please create a user called `hero` — this is you.
* Please create a fake user called `intruder` and then remove this user.


### **Part 2 – Make the Tribes**

* Please create two groups called `warriors` and `healers`.
* Please add `hero` to the `warriors` group.
* Please create another user called `sage` and add them to the `healers` group.


### **Part 3 – The Secret File**

* Please create a file called `treasure.txt` with the text:

  ```
  CyberWorld's Core
  ```
* Please lock this file so no one can read or change it (`000` permission).
* Then:

  1. Please change the owner of the file to `hero`.
  2. Please give `hero` permission to read and write this file.


### **Part 4 – The Wild Programs**

* Please start a fake program in the background (`sleep 100`).
* Please find it using `ps`.
* Please stop it using a signal (`kill`).
